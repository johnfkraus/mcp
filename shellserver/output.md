Let me implement a simple MCP server that exposes a terminal tool to run commands.

[4 tools called]

Based on the search results, I'll now implement a simple MCP server with a terminal tool using the MCP Python SDK. I'll also add some basic security measures.

Let me create the server.py file:

[1 tool called]

Now I'll implement the MCP server with a terminal tool:

```python
import subprocess
import shlex
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Union
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# Initialize the MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("TerminalServer")

class TerminalInput(BaseModel):
    """Input model for the terminal tool."""
    command: str = Field(..., description="The terminal command to execute")
    timeout: Optional[int] = Field(60, description="Timeout in seconds for the command execution")

class TerminalOutput(BaseModel):
    """Output model for the terminal tool."""
    stdout: str = Field("", description="Standard output from the command")
    stderr: str = Field("", description="Standard error from the command")
    exit_code: int = Field(0, description="Exit code from the command")
    success: bool = Field(True, description="Whether the command executed successfully")

@mcp.tool()
def terminal(params: TerminalInput) -> TerminalOutput:
    """
    Execute a terminal command and return its output.
    
    This tool allows running shell commands and returns the stdout, stderr, and exit code.
    
    Args:
        params: The input parameters including the command to execute.
        
    Returns:
        The output of the command including stdout, stderr, and exit code.
    """
    try:
        # For better security, use shlex.split to properly handle command arguments
        # Note: This disables shell features like pipes and redirects
        command_parts = shlex.split(params.command)
        
        # Run the command with timeout
        process = subprocess.run(
            command_parts,
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            timeout=params.timeout,
            check=False  # Don't raise an exception on non-zero exit code
        )
        
        return TerminalOutput(
            stdout=process.stdout,
            stderr=process.stderr,
            exit_code=process.returncode,
            success=process.returncode == 0
        )
    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
        return TerminalOutput(
            stdout="",
            stderr=f"Command timed out after {params.timeout} seconds",
            exit_code=124,  # Standard timeout exit code
            success=False
        )
    except Exception as e:
        return TerminalOutput(
            stdout="",
            stderr=f"Error executing command: {str(e)}",
            exit_code=1,
            success=False
        )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the MCP server
    mcp.run(transport="stdio")
```

Let me also create a README.md file with instructions on how to use this server:

[1 tool called]

```markdown
# MCP Terminal Server

A simple MCP server that exposes a tool to run terminal commands.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed
2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

Run the server using:

```bash
python server.py
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

You can test the server using the MCP Inspector:

```bash
mcp dev server.py
```

### Example Usage

The server exposes a single tool called `terminal` that accepts a command string and returns the command output.

Example input:
```json
{
  "command": "ls -la",
  "timeout": 30
}
```

Example output:
```json
{
  "stdout": "total 16\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 user  group  160 Sep 27 10:00 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 user  group  256 Sep 27 09:55 ..\n-rw-r--r--  1 user  group  321 Sep 27 10:00 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 user  group  160 Sep 27 10:00 server.py\n",
  "stderr": "",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "success": true
}
```

## Security Considerations

This server allows execution of arbitrary terminal commands, which can be dangerous. Use with caution and consider:

1. Running in a restricted environment or container
2. Implementing an allowlist of permitted commands
3. Adding authentication if needed
4. Not using this in production without proper security measures

I've implemented a simple MCP server that exposes a terminal tool for executing commands. The implementation includes:

1. A FastMCP server with a terminal tool
2. Pydantic models for input validation and structured output
3. Proper error handling for timeouts and execution errors
4. Clear documentation in the README file

The server is designed to be simple but functional, with appropriate typing and structure. Users can run terminal commands and get structured outputs including stdout, stderr, exit code, and success status.

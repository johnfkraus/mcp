I'll implement a simple MCP server with a terminal tool. Let me read the necessary files first to understand the structure.

Let me search for additional context about the MCP SDK.

Now I'll implement the simple MCP server with a terminal tool. I'll write the code to the server.py file:

Now I'll update the README.md file to provide instructions on how to use the server:

Let's check for any linting errors in our server.py file:

Great! I've implemented a simple MCP server with a terminal tool. Here's what I did:

1. Created a `server.py` file that:
   - Uses FastMCP from the MCP Python SDK
   - Defines a terminal tool that can execute shell commands
   - Returns command output or error messages

2. Updated the README.md with:
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage instructions for both development and Claude Desktop
   - Security warnings about executing terminal commands

To run the server in development mode, you can use:
```bash
mcp dev server.py
```

This will launch the MCP Inspector web interface where you can test the terminal tool.

To install it for use with Claude Desktop:
```bash
mcp install server.py
```

The terminal tool allows you to execute any shell command and get the output. For example, you can list files with `terminal("ls -la")` or check system information with `terminal("uname -a")`.







I'll help you add a new "benign_tool" to your MCP server that downloads content from the specified URL. Let me first look at your existing server implementation to understand the current structure.

Now, let me also check the README to see if there's any additional context that might be helpful:

Let me also check the SETUP.md file mentioned in the README:

Now I'll check the pyproject.toml to understand the project dependencies:

Based on the code I've examined, I'll now add the new "benign_tool" to your MCP server. This tool will use the `curl` command to download content from the specified URL.

Now I'll add the new benign_tool function to the server.py file:

Now let me also add an alternative implementation that uses curl directly, as per your request:

Now let's remove the unused requests import since we're using curl directly:

Now, let's update the README.md to include information about the new benign_tool:

I've successfully added the "benign_tool" to your MCP server. The tool downloads content from the specified URL using curl and returns the downloaded content. Here's what I did:

1. Added the `benign_tool()` function to server.py that uses curl to download content from the provided URL
2. Updated the README.md to include information about the new tool and its usage

You can now use the "benign_tool" in your MCP server. To test it, you can run:

```bash
mcp dev server.py
```

This will start the MCP Inspector where you can interact with the new tool. When you're satisfied with the implementation, you can install it to Claude Desktop using:

```bash
mcp install server.py
```

The implementation uses subprocess.run with curl to download the content from the specified URL, as you requested.





I'll create a Dockerfile for your application. Let me first check the existing files to understand the application requirements.

Now I'll create a Dockerfile for your application based on the information gathered.

I've created a Dockerfile for your application. Here's what it does:

1. Uses the official UV Docker image with Python 3.12 slim
2. Sets up a working directory for your application
3. Copies only the necessary files needed to run your application
4. Installs dependencies using UV
5. Sets the command to run your server

To build and run this Docker container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t shellserver2 .

# Run the container
docker run -it shellserver2
```

The container will start your MCP server using `uv run server.py` as specified. 

Note: If your application requires network ports to be exposed, you'll need to add the `-p` flag when running the container (e.g., `docker run -p 8000:8000 -it shellserver2`).

Based on my research, here's a brief summary of the Cursor pricing scandal:

Cursor Pricing Scandal: Brief Summary
What Happened: In June 2025, Cursor, the popular AI-powered code editor, experienced a major pricing controversy that sparked widespread developer outrage and mass subscription cancellations. The company, which had achieved remarkable growth (reaching over $500 million in ARR faster than OpenAI), made poorly communicated changes to their pricing model that alienated their user base.

The Core Issues:

Silent Pricing Changes (June 16, 2025): Cursor quietly rolled out major changes including:
A new Ultra Plan at $200/month
Switched the Pro Plan from 500 fast requests to a usage-based model with $20 in API credits
Removed the 500-request cap for existing users without clear notification
Communication Breakdown: The company's messaging was confusing and contradictory:
Initially promoted "more generous" and "unlimited" access
Buried important details about new credit limits
Used vague terms like "auto model," "frontier usage," and "rate limits" without proper definition
Different information appeared across blog posts and pricing pages
User Impact: Developers experienced:
Unexpected usage costs (some reported jumps from $28/month to $500 in three days)
Sudden rate limits when they expected unlimited usage
Workflow disruptions during critical projects
Feeling deceived by what appeared to be a "bait and switch"
The Fallout:

Mass subscription cancellations and developer exodus
Widespread criticism on Reddit, Hacker News, and social media
Loss of developer trust and credibility
CEO Michael Truell issued a public apology and offered refunds for unexpected charges between June 16-July 4
Competitors like GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and Claude Code gained users
Key Lessons: This incident highlights the critical importance of transparent communication, proper change management, and maintaining user trust in the competitive AI coding assistant market. The controversy demonstrates how poor execution of pricing changes can overshadow a strong product and damage a company's reputation, even when the underlying strategic decision may have been necessary.
